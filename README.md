## 1. Front-end

### Problem statement

Sometimes it is easier for decision-makers to analyze data in list format as opposed to a map format. Hence, it's important to have a seamless list-view of the road stretches and their condition. 

### Task description

Build a simple table using Material UI, React, Redux, and Typescript. The table should be able to manage different filters through state management. These are the minimum filters:
`roadname (string)`, `type (categorical)`, `parcelId (numerical)`.

- For `roadname` use a simple search bar and possible some `pill designs` to keep track and easy remove what has already been selected.
- For `type` use a simple dropdown to filter between the possible categorical values.
- For `parcelId` use another dropdown to filter between the possible values.

Use Material UI to get a design that looks like this:
